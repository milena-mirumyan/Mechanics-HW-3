Individual Contributions:

Alik and Milena: Collaboratively implemented the "Continue" button by designing and coding the method to continue scheduling from the current state. Both worked together to integrate the new button into the GUI and test its functionality.

We formed the group to efficiently distribute the workload and leverage our complementary skills in Java GUI development and scheduling algorithms. This collaboration allowed us to meet the project's deadline while ensuring the code was thoroughly tested and well-structured.
