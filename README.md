Individual Contributions:

Alik, Milena, Tamara: Collaboratively implemented the "Continue" button by designing and coding the method to continue scheduling from the current state. We all worked together to integrate the new button into the GUI and test its functionality.

We formed the group to efficiently distribute the workload and leverage our complementary skills in Java GUI development and scheduling algorithms. This collaboration allowed us to meet the project's deadline while ensuring the code was thoroughly tested and well-structured.

Task 2-5 Progress Deadline:

Alik, Milena, Tamara: Collaboratively we have implemented the class Autoassociator class also the getTimeSlot method in CourseArray. We added a new class LogFile to save the number of slots, iterations, min clashes etc when running. We added functions to the TimeTable class to findClashFreeSlots and trainAutoassociatorWithClashFreeSlots. we also created a function interruptIterationsWithUnitUpdates and called it all in the main function. We also added functions saveUsedTimeSlotsLog saveUnitUpdateLog to save the necessary logs.
